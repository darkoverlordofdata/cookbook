## Notes
From Grandma Davidson
"I usually make my dough ahead of time, and refrigerate it.  It is easier to handle.  Make a ball about the size of a large a walnut, and press into tins.  A little flour on figers sometimes helps so the dough doesn't stick.  Don't make the dough too thin or the cookie will break to pieces when you try to get it out of the tin.  Wait a few minutes until the tin has cooled turn it over and tape it with knife or something and the cookie will fall out of tin."
From Genevieve Davidson
"Resist the urge to use all butter, the water it adds will make the cookies tuffer than they need to be. Handle the tins thru a towel to remove the cookies fresh from the oven. Once they cool the metal contracts and the oil starts setting and they become next to impossible to remove."
