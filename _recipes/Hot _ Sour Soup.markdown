Hot & Sour Soup

Full RecipeHalf Recipe

1quart2 Cupschicken stock

1quart2 Cupswater

2tbsp1 Tbsmirin

6tbsp (¼ cup + 2 tbsp) 3 Tbssoy sauce

½cup1/4 Cuprice wine vinegar, unseasoned

2tsp1 tspsesame oil

2tsp1 tspnuc mon (vietnamese fish sauce)

2clove1 clovegarlic, crushed

2inches1 inch ginger, spit down the middle

¼-½tsp (I like ¼ )1/8 tsp crushed red pepper,

2 1leeks, split and in large pieces

42green onions, whites and greens, large pieces

1-2tsp1/4 tspsugar

Add everything but sugar to a big pot and bring to a boil

Take a taste and add a bit of sugar, usually only 1 tsp, but sometimes
the greens make the soup a little bitter, and you won't need any at all
if you use seasoned rice wine vinegar, but who keeps that in the house?

Cover and simmer, medium low heat, for 1 hour.

Strain through cheesecloth, or just a fine sieve

Soup can be kept for approx. 5 days, I've never had it any longer

To serve, return soup to a simmer, serve with thick asian noodles

This soup is an easy side, you may be tempted to half the recipe, but
even covered the soup reduces quite a bit, make a full size batch the
first time.
