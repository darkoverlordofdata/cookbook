# Hot & Sour Soup  
  
|Amount|Ingredient||Half Batch  
||----|----|||----  
1 quart | 2 Cups | chicken stock  
1 quart | 2 Cups | water  
2 Tbsp | 1 Tbsp | mirin  
6 Tbsp (¼ Cup + 2 Tbsp) | 3 Tbsp | soy sauce  
½ Cup | ¼ Cup | rice wine vinegar, unseasoned  
2 tsp | 1 tsp | sesame oil  
2 tsp | 1 tsp | nuc mon (vietnamese fish sauce)  
2 clove | 1 clove | garlic, crushed  
2 inches | 1 inch | ginger, spit down the middle  
¼-½ tsp (I like ¼ ) | ⅛ tsp | crushed red pepper,   
2 | 1 | leeks, split and in large pieces  
4 | 2 | green onions, whites and greens, large pieces  
1-2 tsp | ¼ tsp | sugar  
## Cooking Instructions  
Add everything but sugar to a big pot and bring to a boil  
Take a taste and add a bit of sugar, usually only 1 tsp, but sometimes the greens make the soup a little bitter, and you won’t need any at all if you use seasoned rice wine vinegar, but who keeps that in the house?  
Cover and simmer, medium low heat, for 1 hour.  
Strain through cheesecloth, or just a fine sieve  
Soup can be kept for approx. 5 days, I’ve never had it any longer  
To serve, return soup to a simmer, serve with thick asian noodles  
  
This soup is an easy side, you may be tempted to half the recipe, but even covered the soup reduces quite a bit, make a full size batch the first time.
