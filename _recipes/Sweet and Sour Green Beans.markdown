Sweet and Sour Green Beans

An absolute crowd pleaser, cooks up great with pantry staples, and
easily made in bigger batches

For a 3 person serving

3 strips Bacon, chopped

1 can Cut Green Beans

1 Tbs Dried Minced Onion

2 Tbs Cider Vinegar

1 Tbs Sugar

In a medium pot fry the Bacon over medium heat until brown

Throw in the Dried Onions and toss to coat with the bacon fat, they
should pick up a light brown color

Add the can of Green Beans, undrained, to the pan almost right after the
onions

Add the Vinegar and Sugar, stir, and bring to a boil

Allow to simmer over medium-low heat for 30-45 minutes, I usually start
this first when I make dinner and let it cook until everything else is
done, the liquid should be quite reduced and often has notes of caramel

Finish with a splash of vinegar
