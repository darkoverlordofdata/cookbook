Italian Meatballs

Oven 400°

1 lb ground meat, half pork half beef

1 egg

¼ cup milk

⅓ cup breadcrumbs

½ cup grated parmesan

2 tbs chopped italian ("flat leaf") parsley

½ tsp black pepper

½ tsp red pepper flakes

1 tsp salt

1 diced onion

1 clove diced garlic

Saute onion and garlic in a little olive oil

Mix breadcrumbs, milk, and spices

Add everything to a large bowl and mix just until combined

Form into balls, I use a \#40 disher, and place on a sheet pan lined
with parchment paper

Bake meatballs at 400° for 20 minutes or until done.

1 can pasta sauce

black pepper

basil

sugar

When the meatballs are brown all over, add pasta sauce, and spices to
taste, and turn down to a simmer, one will have broken apart by now, it
means you're doing it right

Balls will be done about when pasta is done, or about ten minutes

Serve with pasta
