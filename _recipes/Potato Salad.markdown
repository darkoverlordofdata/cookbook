# Potato Salad  
  
Make the day before for best flavor.  
  
|Amount|Ingredient|  
|----|----|  
4\~5 Tbsp | bacon bits  
4 | medium potatoes  
5 | large eggs  
¼ Cup | minced red onion  
6 | chips minced bread and butter pickles (yes I know it's a big jar)  
3 oz | minced pimento, comes pre-minced in a small jar  
1\~1½ Tbsp | chopped black olive, comes pre chopped in a small can  
Dressing|  
½ Cup | mayonnaise  
½ Tbsp | dijon mustard  
½ tsp | worcestershire sauce  
dash | Franks, or similar hot sauce  
⅛ tsp | garlic powder  
|| salt and sugar to taste  
  
## Cooking Instructions  
Hard boil the eggs, about 12 minutes, and cool  
  
Prepare the potatoes by cutting the six sides off to get rectangular prisms, this doesn't have to be exact, I usually have to peel the long corners. You just want them to be square enough. Dice the potatoes to be about ¼\~½ inch, about the size of o'briens, if you squared the potatoes properly they should all be nice cubes. Drop potatoes into salted boiling water and cook, about 5 minutes until tender, I never time potatoes because they always take longer if you do, so keep an eye on them.  
  
Mince the onion and pickles, don't be afraid to use a food processor.  
Mince the egg separately, they should NOT be put in a food processor, use an egg slicer if you have one.  
  
Combine the bacon, potatoes, eggs, onion, pickles, pimento, and olives in a large bowl and mix until evenly dispersed. In a separate bowl combine the rest of the ingredients. Pour half the dressing over the potato mixture and stir until just mixed, add the rest of the dressing, you may not need all of it, and mix until well incorporated, but not so much the potatoes fall apart. Make the day before.
