**Ham Buns**

**Description:**

A southern crowd pleaser, these can be made ahead of time and stuck in
the freezer up to 6 months, then baked whenever

**Ingredients List:**

**Amount Of**

1 stick butter

3 tablespoon yellow mustard

1 tablespoon poppy seeds

¼ cup dried minced onion

bunch shredded ham

brick cheddar

dozen buns

**Instructions:**

Soften butter and mix with the other ingredients

Lay bun halves out, cut side up and spread a layer of sauce on each bun,
top and bottom. The sauce layer should be as thick as the dried onions,
so a couple millimeters

Place a scoop of ham on each bottom bun, how much depends on the bun,
but not more than the bun is tall

Put a layer of sliced or planed cheddar on the ham, and place the top
buns on

Wrap each assembled bun in parchment and place in freezer bags, and into
the freezer

Bake frozen buns at 365° for 20 to 30 minutes
