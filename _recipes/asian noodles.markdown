1egg

¾ cupflour

¾ tspsalt

1 ½ to 2 tbspwater

Cooking Instructions:

using a fork, slowly mix the egg, pulling in a little bit of the flour
at a time, until the mixture starts getting thick. Using your hand,
collapse the well onto the egg mixture and squish.

kneading motion. Sometimes the dough just never comes together, don't
