## Cooking Instructions  
  
Season Pork with Salt and Black Pepper  
Heat Vegetable Oil in a pot over high heat.  
Working in batches, cook and stir Pork in hot oil, until browned on all sides, about 5 to 10 minutes.  
Transfer browned Pork to a bowl.  
When all Pork is browned, reduce heat to medium.  
Melt Butter in pot, add Onions and a pinch of Salt.  
Cook Onions until softened and translucent, 7 to 10 minutes.  
Add Garlic, and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  
Add Flour, cook and stir until Flour is completely incorporated, about 2 minutes.  
Add Bay Leaf and Caraway Seeds, cook for 2 minutes.  
Pour Beer into mixture.  
Cook and stir until mixture thickened, about 1 to 3 minutes.  
Stir in browned Pork, Chicken Broth, Carrots, and Celery, bring to simmer.  
Stir in ¼ Cup Parsley and Balsamic Vinegar.  
Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until Pork is fork tender, about 2 hours.  
Bring large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.  
Add Potatoes, and cook until fork tender and mashable.  
When cooked, mash Potatoes with Butter and Salt until smooth.  
Serve stew in bowls over mashed Potatoes.
