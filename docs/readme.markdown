<strike>To update recipes, put them in the new recipe folder, and run the update.py script. Savory and sweet must be updated seperately. On windows use shift+right click to open a power shell window and type `python update.py`. Linux should do the right thing by itself. The update script does not remove files, this is to make it easier to update recipes that need to be fixed. </strike>

serve.bat is a testing utility to run a server off your harddrive to test the pages. Linux users can extract the meaningful python command from that script.

holding is a folder used to hold recipes not ready for prime time. Either they need to be made a couple more times or just rewritten.
