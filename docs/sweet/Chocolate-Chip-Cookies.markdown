|Amount|Ingredient|

2 ½ Cups|Flour
1 tsp|Baking Soda
1 Cup|Softened Butter
1 Cup|Brown Sugar
½ Cup|White Sugar
2|Eggs
1 tsp| Salt
1 ½ tsp| Vanilla Extract

## Cooking Instructions
Mix Flour and Baking Soda and set aside.
Cream Butter with Sugars until smooth.
Add Vanilla Extract, Salt, and the fist Egg.
Mix at low speed untill incorperated, and scrape bowl.
Mix at medium-high speed for approximately 60 seconds, or until mixture holds its shape when the mixer stops.
Scrape the bowl and add the second Egg, following he same instructions as above; mix low at first, then scrape, then mix on med-high. If the mixture looks runny and/or separated, keep mixing.
Add flour, about a half Cup at a time, mixing just till combined.
Add Chocolate Chips all at once, again, mixing just till combined.
Scoop into balls, about the size of a rounded tablespoon, onto partchment paper and freeze.
When balls are solid to the touch, 10-30 minutes, preheat oven to 365.
Move balls onto partchment lined baking sheet, about 2 inches apart.
Bake 11 minutes, or just until a test cookie doesn't totally deflate when poked.
Let cool on pan about 3 minutes, less if bottoms are a bit dark, more if the cookies are a bit soft.

Fun Fact: This recipe was originally tweaked to be cut in half easier, then I upped the vanilla and made it harder.
