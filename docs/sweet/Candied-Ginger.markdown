# Candied Ginger

|Amount|Ingredient|
|----|----|
1 lb. | Fresh Ginger Root
5 Cups | Water
1 lb. | Granulated Sugar

## Cooking Instructions

Spray a cooling rack with nonstick spray, and set it in a half-sheet pan, lined with parchment paper.
Peel the Ginger Root and slice into ⅛-inch thick slices, using a mandoline.
Place into a 4-quart saucepan with the water, and set over medium-high heat.
Cover and cook for 35 minutes or until the ginger is tender.

Transfer the Ginger to a colander to drain, reserving ¼ Cup of the cooking liquid.
Weigh the Ginger and measure out an equal mount of Sugar.
Return and Ginger and ¼ Cup of Ginger Water to the pan, and add the Sugar.
Set over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, stirring frequently, until the sugar syrup looks dry, has almost evaporated, and begins to recrystallize, approximately 20 minutes.
Transfer the ginger immediately to the cooling rack and spread to separate the individual pieces.
Once completely cool, store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.
Save the sugar that drops beneath the cooling rack, and use to top ginger snaps, sprinkle over ice cream, or to sweeten coffee or tea.
