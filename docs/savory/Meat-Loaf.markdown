½ Cup	| J.D.'s BBQ sauce

## Cooking Instructions

Mix together the ground meats until no longer differentiated.
Add soup mix and combine thoroughly using hands, a squish and press method is recommended.
Add the Egg squish until you can't see it.
Add the BBQ Sauce, it should look like you added too much
Lastly add the breadcrumbs, just enough to hold the loaf together, too much and it'll taste like bread

Bake in a 350° oven for 55-60 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°
