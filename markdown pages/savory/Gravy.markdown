# Gravy

|Amount|Ingredient|
|----|----|
2 Tbsp | Butter
2 Tbsp | Flour
 || Pan Drippings, fat removed
 || Stock (opotional)

## Cooking Instructions
In a sauce pan combine Butter and Flour, cook over medium heat 2-5 minutes, until flour is cooked.
Add defatted pan drippings and Stock if using, and bring to boil.
Season to taste.

## Notes
Change the amount of butter and flour depending oh how much pan drippings there are and how much gravy you want.
The rendered fat of the roast can be used in place of butter, however butter provides a creaminess.
Stock is mainly used to bulk out drippings when there isn't alot.
My main recommendation is to over season the gravy with salt, black pepper, and onion powder. The gravy should flirt with being over salted.
