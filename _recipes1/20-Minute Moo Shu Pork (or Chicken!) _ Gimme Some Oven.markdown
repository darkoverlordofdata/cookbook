**INSTRUCTIONS**

**TO MAKE THE MARINADE:**

**TO MAKE THE MOO SHU PORK:**

**NOTES**

*Find it

Whisk all ingredients together in a [medium mixing
bowl](http://amzn.to/2lYfQOS) until combined.  Separate the

marinade into two portions --- one to marinate the meat, and one to
serve as the cooking

sauce.

**1**

Add the thinly-sliced pork (or chicken) to half of the marinade, and
toss until the meat is

evenly coated in the marinade.  Set aside for 5 minutes.

**1**

While the meat is marinating, heat 2 teaspoons oil in a [large saute
pan](http://amzn.to/2lddyqG)[ or wok](http://amzn.to/2lYhMGU) over
medium

heat.  Add the whisked eggs, and let them sit and until they are cooked
and form a large

omelet.  T[ransfer the eggs to a separate cutting board, and set aside.
 W](http://amzn.to/2liTkLZ)hen you have a

chance (while the pork is cooking), chop the omelet into small, thin
pieces.

**2**

Return the pan to the stove, and increase heat to high heat.  Add 1 more
tablespoon of oil,

and then use a pair of tongs (or a fork) to lift the meat out of the
marinade and transfer it to

the pan, discarding the marinade.  Saute the pork, breaking it up and
stirring it with your

tongs occasionally, until it is cooked and tender, about 3-4 minutes.
 Then transfer the pork

to a separate plate, and set aside.

**3**

Add the remaining oil to the pan, along with the cole slaw, mushrooms,
and half of the

scallions.  Saute for 2-3 minutes, or until the cabbage begins to wilt
and softens.

**4**

Add in the reserved marinade for the sauce, and toss to combine.  Cook
for an additional 2

minutes.  Stir in the cooked pork and chopped eggs, and toss until
combined.  Taste, and

season with extra salt and pepper (and/or hoisin or soy sauce) as
needed.  Sprinkle with the

remaining green onions.

**5**

Serve immediately with ﬂour tortillas (or lettuce cups, rice, or
quinoa), and garnish with

optional toppings if desired.

**6**

I just drizzled some extra (warmed) hoisin on top of the skillet before
serving, and also\
drizzled a little extra on the tacos because I'm *obsessed* with hoisin.
 But feel free to just use as\
little or more as you'd like.
