**Hot & Sour Soup**


**Full Recipe Half Recipe**


1 quart 2 Cups chicken stock

1 quart 2 Cups water

2 tbsp 1 Tbs mirin

6 tbsp (¼ cup + 2 tbsp) 3 Tbs soy sauce

½ cup 1/4 Cup rice wine vinegar, unseasoned

2 tsp 1 tsp sesame oil

2 tsp 1 tsp nuc mon (vietnamese fish sauce)

2 clove 1 clove garlic, crushed

2 inches 1 inch ginger, spit down the middle

¼-½ tsp (I like ¼ ) 1/8 tsp crushed red pepper,

2 1 leeks, split and in large pieces

4 2 green onions, whites and greens, large pieces

1-2 tsp 1/4 tsp sugar


Add everything but sugar to a big pot and bring to a boil

Take a taste and add a bit of sugar, usually only 1 tsp, but sometimes
the greens make the soup a little bitter, and you won't need any at all
if you use seasoned rice wine vinegar, but who keeps that in the house?

Cover and simmer, medium low heat, for 1 hour.

Strain through cheesecloth, or just a fine sieve

Soup can be kept for approx. 5 days, I've never had it any longer

To serve, return soup to a simmer, serve with thick asian noodles


This soup is an easy side, you may be tempted to half the recipe, but
even covered the soup reduces quite a bit, make a full size batch the
first time.
