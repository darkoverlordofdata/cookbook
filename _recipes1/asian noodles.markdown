**Asian Noodles**


[Amount]() [Ingredient]()

1 egg

¾ cup flour

¾ tsp salt

1 ½ to 2 tbsp water


[Cooking Instructions:]()

Combine salt and flour and pour on your work surface, make a well

Combine egg and water, and pour into the flour well

using a fork, slowly mix the egg, pulling in a little bit of the flour
at a time, until the mixture starts getting thick. Using your hand,
collapse the well onto the egg mixture and squish.

As the dough starts to form, switch from a squishing motion to a
kneading motion. Sometimes the dough just never comes together, don't
worry just do it again.

Kneed the dough 5 minutes and let rest 30 -- 120 minutes.


Roll out thin and slice into noodles
