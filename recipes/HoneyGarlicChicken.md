## Cooking Instructions  
  
Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and pre-heat oven.  
Finely chop Garlic and place in small bowl.  
Add Honey, Apple Cider Vinegar, and Soy Sauce.  
Whisk to combine ingredients.  
Season Chicken with Salt and Black Pepper  
Heat large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat for 5 minutes.  
Add the Chicken, skin side down; don't overcrowd pan.  
Cook until fat is rendered and skin is golden brown and crisp, about 6 - 8 minutes.  
Flip the Chicken, so skin is up (use all Chicken, if done in batches).  
Pour honey-garlic sauce over the Chicken.  
Place skillet in oven, and roast for 5 minutes.  
Remove the pan from oven, and spoon sauce from pan over Chicken.  
Put back in oven, and continue roasting until Chicken has internal temperature of 165 degrees, 15 to 17 minutes more for Breasts, and 5 to 7 minutes more for thighs.  
Serve Chicken pan sauce, and garnish with sliced scallions.
