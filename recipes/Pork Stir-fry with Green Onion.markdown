Cut Pork Loin into ½ inch slices.  
Cut inch thick Chops in half, horizontially to make two, ½ inch chops.  
Put Pork between plastic wrap or wax paper.  
Pound Pork until ¼ inch thick.  
Cut Pork across the grain into thin strips, about 1 ½ inches long.  
  
*Marinate the Pork*  
Combine Soy Sauce, Sugar, and Corn Starch in a large bowl, and whisk to combine into marinade.  
Add Pork strips to marinade.

*Stir-Fry Pork*  
Put Peanut Oil in a wok, on high heat.  
When Peanut Oil is hot, shimmering, but not smoking, add Garlic.  
Stir-fry Garlic until edges begin to turn brown on the edges, about 30 seconds.  
Add Pork strips to hot Oil and Garlic.  
Stir-fry until Pork changes color, about 90 seconds, stirring constantly.  
Add Scallions, and continue to stir-fry for 1 minute, or until Scallions wilt.  
Turn-off heat, and add Sesame Oil, if using, stirring to combine.  
Serve immediately with rice.
