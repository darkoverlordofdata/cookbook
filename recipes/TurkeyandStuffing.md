Melt 1 stick of Butter in a large fry pan.  
Add Onion and Celery, and allow to sweat and vegetables to soften.  

Sprinkle Seasoning over dry Bread Cubes, in batches, and mix to cover all cubes with seasoning.  

When vegetables are tender, slowly pour vegetables and butter mixture over bread cubes and spices.  
Mix well with hands.  Scoop from the bottom, many spices fall off the bread to the bottom of the pan.  
When bread and vegetables are well mixed, the Turkey can be stuffed.  

Both ends of the turkey are stuffed.  Mash down the stuffing into the opening.  
Put some stuffing under skin on breast and thigh meat to flavor.  

When turkey stuffed, sew ends closed.  
Tie Legs together, and tie wings down.  
Cover turkey with 1/2 stick softened butter.

Remove from oven when cooked, and allow to rest for 5 minutes.  
Remove stitches and remove stuffing to serving dish.
