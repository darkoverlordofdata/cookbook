# Sweet and Sour Green Beans  
  
An absolute crowd pleaser, cooks up great with pantry staples, and  
easily made in bigger batches  
  
|Amount|Ingredient|  
|----|----|  
3 strips | Bacon, chopped  
1 can | Cut Green Beans  
1 Tbsp | Dried Minced Onion  
2 Tbsp | Cider Vinegar  
1 Tbsp | Sugar  
  
## Cooking Instructions  
In a medium pot fry the Bacon over medium heat until brown  
  
Throw in the Dried Onions and toss to coat with the bacon fat, they  
should pick up a light brown color  
  
Add the can | of Green Beans, undrained, to the pan almost right after the  
onions  
  
Add the Vinegar and Sugar, stir, and bring to a boil  
  
Allow to simmer over medium-low heat for 30-45 minutes, I usually start  
this first when I make dinner and let it cook until everything else is  
done, the liquid should be quite reduced and often has notes of caramel  
  
Finish with a splash of vinegar
