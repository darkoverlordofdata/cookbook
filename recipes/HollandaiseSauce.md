## Cooking Instructions  
Vigorously whisk Egg Yolks and Lemon Juice together in a stainelss steel bowl until mixture is thickened and doubled in volume.  
Place bowl over a sauce pan with barely simmering water (or use a double bowler).  Water should not touch the bottom of the bowl.  
Continue to rapidly whisk mixture.  Do Not allow mixture to get too hot or the eggs will cook.  
Slowly drizzle in the melted buter, and continue to whisk until the sauce is thickened and doubled in volume.  
Remove from heat.  
Whisk in Chili and Salt.  
Serve immediately, or cover and keep in a warm spot until ready to use.  
If thickens, whisk in a few drops of warm water before serving.
